#types of machine learning
#1. supervised learning -labelled datam, structured data, image classification 
'''
Common algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forests

- Deep Learning (CNN) -Image classification building .h5

#2. unsupervised learning -unlabelled data, structured data, clustering, discovery of hidden patterns
'''
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
